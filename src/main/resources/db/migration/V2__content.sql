    SET content=E'<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Last summer, when Boston cancer surgeon Monica M. Bertagnolli heard she might be selected to lead the National Cancer Institute, she asked a friend whether she would be able to do the job.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">It was a disarming display of humility from an accomplished professional who has removed gastrointestinal tumors as big as pumpkins and herded not only Black Angus cattle on a Wyoming ranch but also thousands of strong-minded oncologists conducting clinical trials. Bertagnolli said her friend gave her a vote of confidence, adding, &ldquo;You are kind of annoying &mdash; you never take no for an answer.&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2022/bertagnolli-nci-director" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October</a>, Bertagnolli became the 16th director of the cancer institute and the first woman to have the job. And then, just before Thanksgiving, her life took an unexpected turn: The 63-year-old Bertagnolli was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer after a routine mammogram in Boston.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">On Wednesday, Bertagnolli held her first town hall with thousands of employees, outlining her vision for the cancer institute and explaining her medical situation &mdash; topics she also discussed recently with The Washington Post. She made clear that while she will have to slow down from her ferociously rapid pace for a while, she expects the change to be temporary.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Bertagnolli has the most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7374796/#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20breast%20cancers,resulting%20in%20improved%20survival%20outcomes." target="_blank" rel="noopener">common type</a>&nbsp;of breast cancer for someone her age &mdash; hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, she said.

    SET content=E'<p class="MsoNormal">Even the inside cover of&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3BzZOjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Cure: New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix &lsquo;Em,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;Neal Bodenheimer and Emily Timberlake&rsquo;s gorgeous new cocktail book, reminded me why the Crescent City is my favorite place in the world to get a drink.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That inside cover is a map of some of the most important watering holes, restaurants and live music joints around the city. For people who have the good fortune to know New Orleans, it&rsquo;s a map of both remembered pleasures and those still to be explored; for those yet to eat, drink and explore this joyful, sorrowful city, it&rsquo;s a cartographical to-do list, one the book later supplements with a &ldquo;New Orleans Cocktail Bucket List.&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The map captures something about the spirit of the book, which is not just a celebration of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.curenola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cure</a>, one of the country&rsquo;s best cocktail bars &mdash; a perennial James Beard nominee that won for Best Bar Program in 2018 &mdash; but a celebration of its community and city. Any number of books teach readers about cocktails through the lens of the bar they&rsquo;re representing and recipes for drinks its mixologists have created. Far fewer also amplify their city and their neighbors (and nominal competitors) so generously.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bodenheimer almost had to be hogtied and dragged into writing it.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/12/15/cure-cookbook-roffignac-recipe/#recipe">Jump to the recipe</a></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">To be fair, it&rsquo;s not like the man doesn&rsquo;t have a few other projects on his hands. Along with Cure, which he opened in 2009 after moving back to his native Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, Bodenheimer owns Cane &amp; Table in the French Quarter, and over the course of the pandemic, while he was writing, he opened Dauphine&rsquo;s (a New Orleans-inspired restaurant in Washington, D.C.), as well as Val&rsquo;s (a taqueria and agave spirits bar in the same neighborhood as Cure) and Peychaud&rsquo;s (a cocktail bar in the courtyard of a French Quarter building that was once home to Antoine Peychaud, the inventor of the red bitters that now give a licorice-y hit to countless cocktails). And he also serves as a partner in Tales of the Cocktail, the annual bar conference that attracts thousands of industry folks and dedicated tipplers to the city every summer.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Which all makes it sound like I&rsquo;m &hellip; insane &hellip; but it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be that way,&rdquo; Bodenheimer says, noting how the pandemic played hell with so many plans and threw off so much original project timing. But he knew he&rsquo;d never get the book done without help, and Timberlake, a longtime food writer and editor based in Oakland, Calif., proved to be the perfect partner in the project. Their calls and planning sessions for the book helped keep him sane during the pandemic, when so much seemed to be coming apart.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bodenheimer knew he &ldquo;didn''t want to do another bar-bar book, because so many bars have made bar books that I think it''s a pretty complete genre. And I didn''t want to do a vanity project either &hellip; . I want to talk about what Cure is and what it''s done, but I want to put it into the larger context of New Orleans drinking.&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Thus the book provides plenty of drinks that are original to Cure and the many creative mixologists who have worked there over the years, but it also provides the history of many New Orleans classic cocktails, and recipes for iterations of and riffs on such drinks as the French 75 and the Pimm&rsquo;s Cup, not originally New Orleans drinks but which, through specific bars (Arnaud&rsquo;s and the Napoleon House, respectively) have become indelibly associated with the city.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>'
